This Max4Live device was designed to automate some of the melody-writing process I use in my own music (mostly uplifting trance).

It is open source and available on both [maxforlive.com](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/6170/uplift-arpeggio) and [GitHub](https://github.com/dfilaretti/uplift-arpeggio) where contributions or bug reports are welcome. 

For detailed info and demo, please see the [README](https://github.com/dfilaretti/uplift-arpeggio/blob/master/README.md).
