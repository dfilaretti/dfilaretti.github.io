WeirdDrums is a free and open source little drum synth plugin inspired by the awesome [Sonic Charge Microtonic](https://soniccharge.com/microtonic), one of my favourite plugins. All sounds are synthesised in realtime - no samples used!

For audio examples, downloads, source code, documentations and FAQs, please visit the [project website](https://dfilaretti.github.io/WeirdDrums).

Here are a bunch of screenshots using various colour themes:
