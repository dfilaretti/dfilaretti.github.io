[DIMMAND](http://www.dimmand.co.uk/) is a game-based, digital education and health solution for detecting and managing literacy difficulties in children (4-8 years) based on recent neuroscience research.

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was developed using the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine (C#) and runs on Windows, Android and iOS.
