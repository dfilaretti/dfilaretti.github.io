Forming the central topic of my [PhD thesis](../../assets/downloads/papers/Filaretti-D-PhD-2016.pdf), KPHP is a _formal_ (mathematical) specification for the PHP programming language developed using the [K Framework](https://runtimeverification.com/k/).

Applications include the development of a prototype correct-by-construction [bug-finding tool](https://github.com/dfilaretti/PHP-Static-Analyser) derived from the specification using the theory of [abstract interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation).
